## My process

 I started by reviewing the design specification.  I then started markup knowing that the mobile and desktop layouts would use the same cards, with different page layouts.  From there, I stated the styling with mobile-first workflow and then created two media queries to handle the transition from the mobile to the desktop layouts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was an excellent excercise in CSS grid and I learned how CSS grid made the layout of the individual card and the page significantly easier than traditional CSS. I learned how to use minmax, auto, and 1fr to make the page flow from mobile-first to the desktop.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to the next project to build on the CSS grid experience and to add JavaScript for an additional challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) - Kevin Powell is an excellent teacher and I relied heavily on the notes that I took from his CSS courses taught on scrimba.com.
- [A Complete Guide to Grid ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) -  I have found css.tricks.com to be a valuable resourse for grid, flexbox, and all things CSS.
